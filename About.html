      <h2>We Rise From Madness</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Pleading Sanity</strong> was born from the chaos — the sleepless nights, the bruises you can’t see, the moments when hope was just a rumour.  
        We are not polished. We are not perfect. We are proof that broken things still shine.
      </p>
      <blockquote style="color:#ff00ff;border-left:3px solid #00fff0;padding-left:12px;margin:18px 0;font-style:italic">
        “They say it’s the genius disease. Maybe they’re right. But this movement wasn’t built for the spotlight — it was built for survival, for leaving something real behind for my kids, and for everyone who never got to tell their story.”<br>
        — Shane, Founder

      <p>
        We believe pain is a superpower if you survive it. Every hoodie, every podcast, every game, every story in the Sanity Hub is a reminder: you are not alone in this fight.
      </p>
      <h3>What Makes Us Different</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Unfiltered Truth:</strong> We don’t hide the scars. Here, your story is currency, your struggle is welcome, and your comeback is celebrated.</li>
        <li><strong>Built By Survivors:</strong> This isn’t corporate — it’s crafted by those who lived it. Mental health isn’t a hashtag; it’s the frontline of our lives.</li>
        <li><strong>Cosmic Community:</strong> Our goal is a galaxy of healing: streetwear with a story, gyms that welcome the broken, AI tools that actually listen, and a feed that feeds your soul.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>This Movement Is For You</h3>
      <p>
        When you join Pleading Sanity, you’re not buying into hype. You’re helping build safe spaces for anyone who feels “too much” — and creating tools, content, and culture that give back.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re building what we never had: a place where survival is respected, pain is transformed, and support is more than words on a page.
      </p>
      <div style="background:rgba(0,255,240,0.07);padding:18px 16px;border-radius:18px;margin:28px 0">
        <p style="font-size:1.1em;font-weight:600;color:#00fff0">
          This is Pleading Sanity — the movement where you become the message.<br>
          Where your comeback becomes someone else’s survival guide.<br>
          Where our madness builds a legacy, and our scars become our badge of honor.<br>
          <a href="sanity-hub.html" style="color:#ff00ff;text-decoration:underline">Step inside the Sanity Hub</a>, or <a href="shop.html" style="color:#ff00ff;text-decoration:underline">wear the change</a> — and help us turn the world’s pain into a movement for hope.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>Why Now?</h3>
      <p>
        Because the world is drowning in fake “motivation.” Because there’s no app for real hope. Because no brand is telling the raw truth — but we will.  
        With your help, we’ll build gyms, launch podcasts, and drop gear that funds real healing.  
        We’re not just here to talk — we’re here to change the story, one survivor at a time.
