🧠 Pleading Sanity — Rise From Madness

> A mental health revolution disguised as a streetwear brand, a digital hub, and a global movement.
We’re not building a website. We’re building a legacy.

🌌 What Is Pleading Sanity?

Pleading Sanity is born from raw struggle — bipolar highs, survival fights, madness, and rebuilding from zero.

Now it’s becoming:

A cosmic healing hub for mental health warriors.

A streetwear brand that wears scars as badges (Crying Brain Collection).

A community platform for journaling, gaming, and growth.

A blueprint for the future: MMA therapy gyms, AI companions, and sanity-first social media.


Every click, hoodie, and journal entry says:
👉 “I survived. I rise. I turn pain into purpose.”

💎 Why This Matters

The world doesn’t need another clothing brand.
The world doesn’t need another app.

The world needs a movement that turns pain into power.
That’s what Pleading Sanity is.

For the kid who thinks they’re “too much.”

For the fighter who feels alone.

For the survivor who wants legacy.

For every human who ever felt madness clawing at their mind.


This isn’t just Shane’s project.
It’s ours.

⚡ Manifesto

> This isn’t just code. This isn’t just fashion. This isn’t just content.

Pleading Sanity is survival dressed as art, healing coded into pages, and madness reborn as meaning.

From pain to power. From scars to style. From chaos to cosmos.

We don’t beg for sanity.
We build it.
